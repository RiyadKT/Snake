#Snake Game with A* Algorithm and CNN-based Pathfinding

This repository contains an implementation of the classic Snake game enhanced with two key features:

A Pathfinding Algorithm*: An intelligent pathfinding system that helps the snake find its way to the food.
CNN-based Strategy: A convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to enhance gameplay by recognizing optimal strategies and handling complex game situations.


## Features

Playable Snake Game: Control the snake manually or let the AI (A*) take over for automated gameplay.
A Pathfinding*: Uses the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path to the food, avoiding collisions.
CNN-based Decision Making: The neural network improves the snake's decision-making process in various challenging situations.
Customizable Settings: Tune the game speed, grid size, and AI behavior to test different scenarios.
